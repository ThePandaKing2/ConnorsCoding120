            <h1 class="title">Welcome to My Short Story!</h1>
        <br>
        <span class="header">NAME: Zhann Dro
RACE: Kel Dor
CLASS: Scoundrel
AGE: 35
HEIGHT: 6'5" (2m)</span>

        <p id="color">Zhann Dro of Dorin grew up from a very wealthy family. Being the youngest child of six, when he was born his parents expected another force prodigy. Unfortunately for him, he wasn't. From an early age his parents saw him as a burden. His brothers and sisters were whisked away to the Jedi Academy, or to the Baran Do, while he stayed on his home planet.
        </p>
        <p id="color">When he finally came of age to join the military, his parents disowned him, saying "no child of ours could be such a failure as you". He tried everything to appease them, but nothing would do. Broken, and alone, he enrolled into the military academy.
        </p>
        <p id="color">	Only sixteen he did what he could to master weaponry and the martial arts. For two years he excelled at blasters, computer technology, and could was a fairly good at simulated piloting. However, one night he came upon a group of commanders quarreling about Baran Do Sages trying to recruit young militants away from "this life." Fearing he would fail once again, the next day he packed his bags, and attempted to leave the planet. After using what little money he had to acquire transport off planet, he found it wasn't who he would have originally expected.</p>
        <p id="color">He sat in the cockpit with Jedi Master Plo Koon. He was visiting his home world to meet with the Baran Do. Upon leaving Plo had heard a story about a young Kel Dor trying to get off world, and felt he could oblige. When the two landed on Coruscant, Plo returned the money, telling him, "You may not have the same power your siblings have, but you have more drive to do good than any Jedi I've ever met." Before their paths split for now, he gave Zhann a small coin.
        </p>
        <p id="color">	Working in the underworld of one of the most prestigious core worlds. Moving packages from the lower levels to all across Coruscant. Sometimes even ferrying information to the senates highest towers.  Three years had passed since Zhann arrived on Coruscant and had stashed away enough credits to purchase his own freighter. Setting up a meet with a Twi'lek called Mulran Novar in "The Works". Upon meeting with the Twi'lek, Zhann found he was met with a trap. Three smugglers emerged and attempted to kill the young Scoundrel, not knowing Zhann had real training. Shooting down the newly emerged threats, Zhann proved that day he was not the put upon boy from Dorin any longer. Unfortunately, Mulran escaped that day.</p>
        <p id="color">	Before leaving Coruscant for longer than he could imagine, Zhann took on his the largest cargo to date. Filling his HWK-290 with as much cargo as he could, he plotted a course for Nar Shaddaa. Landing on Cato Neimodia, he refueled and off loaded several crates of custom statues for a droid manufacturer called Lok Durd. With one stop before Nar Shaddaa the young scoundel plotted his course for Kashyyk. Landing on the the forest planet he was greeted by a clan of wookies led by Kallaaddik. The wookies spoke in grunts and roars, making a language barrier that he had never dealt with so severely. Kallaaddik partnered Zhann with a young Wookie named Tarffahr, unknowingly meeting a life long friend.
        </p>
        <p id="color">	With the few months Zhann stayed on Kashyyk, his understanding of the language came to him gradually. Zhann and Tarffahr had grown a bond, adventuring around the planet. Finally Zhann had found and delivered a crate of parts to a leader on a secluded forest island. Knowing his job was complete it was onto Nar Shaddaa. There was one problem, Tarffahr wanted to join him, promising it would only be till Nar Shaddaa, then Zhann could drop him back on the planet. Zhann agreed with his new friend, and left for the underworld planet of Nar Shaddaa.</p>
        <p id="color">Nar Shaddaa was good to the duo. After offloading almost one hundred and fifteen metric tons of rations, arms, ship parts, and a few special data pads. While trying to deliver one of the pads, a Bounty Hunter called Kraspen Mar-Shayal intercepted them. She told Zhann and Tarffahr that the data pad held something that safe guarded a notorius Hutt named Yama Shan, and if this information got to it intended recipient, it would mean the downfall of Nar Shaddaa. Zhann wanted to review the datapad before he made his decision.</p>
        <p id="color">Zhann and Kraspen went to their ship, plugging the pad into the ship's holo terminal. Blue ghosts of memories past. It played out a council of Hutts talking about over throwing the current leader of the Cartel and taking it for themselves. Zhann knew this could start a galaxy wide dispute and could end his career before it began. Zhann conferred with Tarffahr, together they came to the conclusion of turning the pad into the leader of Nar Shaddaa Rath Smague. With the transfer of the datapad, Rath gave them a fake pad to infect Yama's servers. Before Kraspen left, she gave Zhann a personal deep space comlink.
        </p>
        <p id="color">With the infected datapad delivered, Zhann and Tarffahr took their riches off planet and returned to Kashyyk. With the wealth Zhann and Tarffahr brought back to Tar's home planet, they were welcomed back as heroes. Tarffahr had honored Zhann as part of his honor family. Zhann knew he had to keep his promise and leave Tarffahr. With a heavy heart, Zhann left Kashyyk, leaving Tarffahr with a long range comlink just incase Zhann was ever needed again.
        </p>
        <p id="color">Traveling from Kashyyk to Bastion, Mon Calamari to Utapau. A year passed, Zhann felt his ship was cold and empty without his honor family friend Tarffahr. Contacting him through the comlink, Tarffahr confessed he found that his wanderlust was too much, and he missed the adventure. Zhann returned to Kashyyk, and landing in Tarffahr's village. Grabbing anything they could of Tarffahr's belongings, and took off to the skies.
        </p>
        <p id="color">	Across the universe the duo flew, amassing massive wealth. After the blockade of Naboo, the two started running arms, persons of interest, and most of all, information. Sneaking through the Trade Federation lines, extracting information from special operations that the separatists conducted, and returning it to the republic. Upon landing on a wayward moon Zhann and Tarffahr were ambushed by a group of mercenaries. They were after Tarffahr, there was a rumor of a Wookie in the Outer Rim causing problems. When they tried to execute the wooly man, Zhann jumped in front of the blaster bolt, taking it to the shoulder. Tarffahr shot down the mercenaries, and flew Zhann to the nearest medical base two moons away. After that night, Tarffahr swore to Zhann that he would never leave his side, a life debt.
        </p>
        <p id="color">Never leaving a name to their work in fear of being tracked down and killed, they were only known as "The Shadows of the Outer Rim". Working with other smugglers of all shapes and sizes, unfortunately they did run into trouble more than they would have hoped. Upon arriving on Ord Mantell, the two were met by a very familiar Twi'lek, Mulran Novar.  Mulran had come under the wing of another part of Zhann's past, the Hutt lord, Yama Shan. This time, Zhann wasn't going to deal with this low life again. Letting Tarffahr distract Mulran, Zhann got the upper hand and put a blaster bolt through him. It was the first time Zhann had ever killed anyone in cold blood, and even though he knew what he had done was justified, it haunted him.
        </p>
        <p id="color">Meeting with a Mon Calamari called Meena Eerin, Zhann used her knowledgable with a star fighter, she ran interference, and helped infiltrate high security sites. Becoming fast friends, she worked with Zhann and Tarffahr extremely frequently for a good while. After a good year of working together, Zhann offered to let her join the rambunctious duo, but she declined. Even after that, their paths did cross more often than naught. She would scout for the republic, looking for the same thing Zhann was, money.
        </p>
        <p id="color">Years past, the republic had finally passed the Military Creation act, and work was war. Zhann had been partnered with a Jedi called Genovin Organ and his apprentice, shuffling their newest cargo from battlefield to battlefield. The Republic paid them handsomely, but it wasn't the same. The thrill of moving crates of goods across the galaxy lost most of it's excitement. After a long campaign on Muunilinst, Zhann and Tarffahr returned to Coruscant, where they looked into leaving the republic's grasp and returning to what they knew best.
        </p>
        <p id="color">Using Coruscant as a home base, Zhann began to see the republic wasn't where they belonged anymore. Getting ready to travel to Nar Shaddaa, Zhann ran into someone he never thought he would ever see again. Yama Shan had impounded their ship, and with it, everything they had amassed was locked upon this ship. Zhann had to watch as his ship, his prized blaster, and all his fortune was drug out of Coruscant space. Yama had hacked into the ships licensing, deleting that Zhann had ever owned such a ship, effectively leaving him as he had left Yama.  Zhann Dro was stuck on Coruscant, with nothing but his cloak, and a light blaster. Zhann felt like he had almost twenty years ago, broken and alone.
        </p>
        <p id="color">	Returning to the republic for help, they employed both Zhann and Tarffahr on Coruscant, to go where no republic soldier or agent could. Traveling the underworld, there were whispers of separatists in the core planets. When Zhann returned with this new information, the duo were called to a secret meeting. To where it would him, Zhann did not know...</p>
