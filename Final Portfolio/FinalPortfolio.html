        <h1 class="title">Welcome to my Final Portfolio!</h1>
        <p>For this semester I actually came into the class by accident. I had gotten waitlisted and needed to fill a spot, and figured that Creative Coding 1 would be a good fit. I had taken web design before, and figured it would transfer over well.</p>
        <p>The first week we went over the differences between GUI and CLI, along with how we could be doing our quizzes with Kahoot (apperently I'm an old geezer and had never used it before). We also had our first introduction to the weekly discussion posts which I rather enjoyed.</p>
        <p>In our second week we started our ever weaivng path to learn how to code. In all honesty, I had no idea these little puzzles would end up being so helpful down the line, but man were they fun. It allowed us the chance to play around within the code without the necessity of actually knowing how to actually write the language. We also got to draw a picture with code, mine ended up being a viking ship will a little viking fella on top.</p>

        <p>Moving to week 3, we got to work within Scratch 3,  which was quite fun. I was able to create a fun horror style video based on the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise. Unfortunately, my sound got screwed up at some point. I also laughed pretty hard when I was able to get the Freddy head to shoot around the screen at mach 10. If you want to try it, click the picture and you can save my file from GitHub and watch it yourself! </p>

        <p>Week 4 we did more puzzle coding, but we dealt with much more complex interactions such as collisions, and point generation. We also played around with the concept of mobile app generation, which I was able to create a quest adventure based on the best piece of literature ever, Berserk. Once again, click on the pictures to be able to try them out for youself!</p>

        <p>Moving forward to week 5, we got to use Alice 3, a game generating program, (it actually was the engine that made one of the Sims games) so of course, it was time to bring a bit of norse mythology to life. I tried to create an over-the-shoulder style mini game where you play as Thor, I was able to create interations with items in the world that would make things happen within the game. Walking over the spear activated Loki to speak with you, when Loki had a collision with the lightning, it caused him to shrink and fall through the floor to disappear. As always, click that picture to go to GitHub, and save the file to give it a shot for yourself.</p>

        <p>For weeks 6, 7, and 8 we worked in HTML and CSS creating a webpage that you could effect all pages with styles and sheets, being able to clean up our code to have a neat, interesting way to code in HTML. We also played around with contact sheets and information gathering through an online form, which, as always, I had a little fun with some of the answers. I had taken 3 years of web design before this, and I learned more in these few weeks than I had in those years handily. If you click the links at the bottom you can see the other pages, and come back here! I'll also link to GitHub so you can see my code if you so desire.</p>

        <p>We switched gears for the rest of the semester to code within p5js, an extremely powerful coding platform that integrated style sheets, and coding types that allowed us to create things in a much more creative manner over just basic coding might be able to. We were able to create canvases, shapes, movement and even basic games within it just using setups and a "draw" function, that allowed us to bring the code to life. For week 9 and 10, we worked with a self portrait, using basic shapes to create the profile, then having the shapes more around in random directions, reacting with the edges of the screen to keep everything on the canvas. Hit the pictures to see the projects in full!</p>

        <p>Finally, for the last few weeks, we created the shell for a game within p5js. We created a canvas, we created a character, enemies, a placeable obstacle, and an exit with a congratulations message when you head through the exit. As we moved from week to week, we cleaned up our code by creating functions, being able to keep out draw function clean. Then working with arrays, something to once again help clean up our code, and create multiple instances of an object, or use of a variant. We also played around with contolling a character through button/key presses, and boundry creation and movement continuation within those boundries. Below I have the two versions of the game shell pictured, the first and third will have links to the functioning games.</p>

        <P>We finally come to an end, this page here is the final portfolio for everything we did, I really enjoyed this class, and I am very glad I decided to take this course in my first semester. I'd like to thank both Michael and Shanel for all their help, and support throughout. </P>
